# ML/AI Engineering Mastery Journey

This repository documents my 10-month journey to master Machine Learning and AI Engineering through a structured curriculum with 213 strategic LeetCode problems and focused project implementations.

## Journey Overview

This learning plan consists of:
- Daily 4-hour deep work sessions (50 min work + 10 min break √ó 3, plus documentation)
- 308 days of structured learning across 10 months
- Implementation projects ranging from basic ML algorithms to advanced architectures
- Regular reflection and progress tracking

## Current Progress

- üü¢ Currently on: Day 1 - Setup & Environment Preparation
- ‚è±Ô∏è Overall completion: 0% (0/308 days)
- üß© LeetCode problems solved: 0/213

## Repository Structure

- **progress-tracker/**: Daily logs and weekly reviews
- **code-implementations/**: ML/AI implementations organized by topic
- **leetcode-solutions/**: Solutions to algorithmic problems
- **projects/**: Larger projects and competition submissions
- **papers/**: Notes on research papers
- **resources/**: Learning materials and references

## Monthly Focus Areas

1. **Month 1**: Foundations Setup & Algorithms
2. **Month 2**: Neural Networks & Optimization
3. **Month 3**: Trees & Optimization Algorithms
4. **Month 4**: Graph Algorithms & CNN Implementation
5. **Month 5**: Dynamic Programming & RNN Implementation
6. **Month 6**: Attention Mechanisms & Transformers
7. **Month 7**: Transformer Architecture & NLP Applications

## Learning Approach

I'm following a structured 10-month curriculum with daily 4-hour deep work sessions. Each session follows this structure:
- 50-minute Focus Block + 10-minute Break (3 cycles)
- 30-minute Implementation Documentation
- 10-minute Next Session Preparation
